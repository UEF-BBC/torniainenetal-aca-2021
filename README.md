This repository contains the source code for the three examples included in the 2021 Torniainen et al manuscript.

For examples 1 and 2 the data can be acquired from:
<https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/925999ad-8127-4428-b7cc-c03c12e62d3c/data>
and
<https://www.kaggle.com/fkosmowski/crop-varietal-identification-with-scio>

The data for example 3 has not yet been made publicly available.

To run the examples you need to have `nippy`, `tpot`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas` and `scikit-learn` modules installed.  You can install the latest version of `nippy` with pip directly from the repository.

`pip install git+https://github.com/uef-bbc/nippy`

All the other modules can be found in PyPi.
